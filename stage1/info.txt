stage info:
1.We parse an arithemetic sequence and make a expression tree using lex and yacc
2.Recursvly traverse the tree and produce the assembly langauge code

XSM virtual machine is model on a os which has a unprivilaged usermode operations can do 
so it assigns a some space for registers and a virtual space for the machine

EXPL transalte the souce program and generate the target machine ->executbale program to load module of the target OS.

Compiler needs following for generating the executable file:
1.Virtual machine model and instruction set  of the target machine

2.Virtual machine address avialble for the target program   , code data stack heap

3.the format for the target file  Compiler passes info about the executable file by the header.

4.Interface to OS kernel routines.
